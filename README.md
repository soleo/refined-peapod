# refined-peapod
An opinionated way of using Peapod. I'm not saying this is the only way,
but I do like cleaner design rather than complex.


### UI Improvements

- [X] Cleaner Category Tree and Remove Icons Before the Category Name
- [X] Larger font size for the headings and copy block in splash pages
- [X] Better Alignment for specials pod groups shelf header
- [X] Remove all sales flags to make UI cleaner
- [X] Simplify Navigation and Removed Express Shop, Delivery Time and Favorites
- [X] Remove Notification Bar and Hi, User Message
- [ ] Better format for Item Detail Description so that I can actually read.

- [ ] Support Custom Domain Name

### Function Improvements
- [ ] Linkify the content in Item Detail
- [ ] Quick Search in Google, Amazon, Instacart
- [ ] If I cannot find my grocery here, I need to quick way to find it somewhere else
- [ ] If I want Peapod to carry the item I want, I want to provide an easy way to add the item. Expose it to the top navigation bar
