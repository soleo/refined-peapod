# refined-peapod
An opinionated way of using Peapod. I'm not saying this is the only way,
but I do like cleaner design rather than complex.

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Night Mode Support
- [ ] Clean Category Tree and Remove Icons
- [ ] Simply Nav and Remove The menu item that I don't use often
- [ ] Remove Notification Bar and Hi Message
- [ ] Better format for Item Detail Description so that I can actually read.
- [ ] Remove all sales flags to make UI cleaner

### Function Improvements
- [ ] Linkify the content when I see one
- [ ] Quick Search in Google, Amazon, Instacart
- [ ] If I cannot find my grocery here, I need to quick way to find it somewhere else
- [ ] If I want peapod to carry the item I want, I want to provide an easy way to add the item. Expose it to the top navigation bar
